# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Aim

To develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.

## Objective

The primary objective is to build a model that accurately classifies passengers as either survived or not survived based on their characteristics.

## Process

1. **Data Collection**:
   - The project utilizes the Titanic dataset, a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, containing information about passengers on the Titanic.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features.
   - Data transformation: Converting categorical features into numerical representations.
   - Data scaling: Standardizing numerical features to a common range.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing data patterns, correlations, and distributions to gain insights into factors influencing survival.
4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Selecting and transforming features to enhance model performance.
5. **Model Selection**:
   - Evaluating various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests.
6. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Training the chosen model on a subset of the data and evaluating its performance on a separate test set.
   - Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

## Summary Conclusion

The project successfully built and evaluated several machine-learning models to predict Titanic passenger survival. The comparison revealed that the Support Vector Machine Classifier achieved the highest accuracy, indicating its potential for effective prediction in this scenario. While other models demonstrated decent accuracy, the Support Vector outperformed them.

## Further Improvements

- Explore advanced feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
- Experiment with different hyperparameter settings to optimize the chosen model.
- Consider ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy.
