# **Problem Statement**

The *Iris flower* is a widely recognized genus of flowering plants, known for its distinctive features and vibrant colors. Within this genus, there are three primary species: **Iris setosa**, **Iris versicolor**, and **Iris virginica**. These species differ significantly in their physical characteristics, particularly in the measurements of their:

- Sepal length  
- Sepal width  
- Petal length  
- Petal width
